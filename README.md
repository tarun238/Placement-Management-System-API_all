## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### **Prerequisites**

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or later

### **Setup and Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh

    cd Placement-Managment-System-
    ```

2.  **Database Configuration:**
    * Open PostgreSQL and create a new database named `placement_db`.
    * Navigate to `src/main/resources/`.

3.  **Create a local properties file:**
    * Create a new file named `application-local.properties`.
    * Add your database password to this file:
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.password=your_secret_password_here
        ```
    * The main `application.properties` is already configured to use this file.

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
